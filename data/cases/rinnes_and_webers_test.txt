Rinne's and Weber's test 
Performing both Rinne's and Weber's test allows differentiation of conductive and sensorineural deafness.

Rinne's test
tuning fork is placed over the mastoid process until the sound is no longer heard, followed by repositioning just over external acoustic meatus
'positive test': air conduction (AC) is normally better than bone conduction (BC)
'negative test': if BC > AC then conductive deafness

Weber's test
tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead equidistant from the patient's ears
the patient is then asked which side is loudest
in unilateral sensorineural deafness, sound is localised to the unaffected side
in unilateral conductive deafness, sound is localised to the affected side

Interpretation of Rinne and Weber tests

Rinne result	Weber result
Normal	Air conduction > bone conduction bilaterally	Midline
Conductive hearing loss	Bone conduction > air conduction in affected ear
Air conduction > bone conduction in unaffected ear	Lateralises to affected ear
Sensorineural hearing loss	Air conduction > bone conduction bilaterally	Lateralises to unaffected ear
