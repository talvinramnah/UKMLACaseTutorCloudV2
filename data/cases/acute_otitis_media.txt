Acute otitis media 
Acute otitis media is extremely common in young children, with around half of children having three or more episodes by the age of 3 years.

Pathophysiology
whilst viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) typically precede otitis media, most infections are secondary to bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumonaie, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis
viral URTIs are thought to disturb the normal nasopharyngeal microbiome, allowing bacteria to infect the middle ear via the Eustachian tube

Clinical features and diagnosis

Features
otalgia
some children may tug or rub their ear
fever occurs in around 50% of cases
hearing loss
recent viral URTI symptoms are common (e.g. coryza)
ear discharge may occur if the tympanic membrane perforates

Possible otoscopy findings:
bulging tympanic membrane → loss of light reflex
opacification or erythema of the tympanic membrane
perforation with purulent otorrhoea
decreased mobility if using a pneumatic otoscope

Whilst guidelines vary, the majority use the following criteria to diagnose otitis media:
acute onset of symptoms
otalgia or ear tugging
presence of a middle ear effusion
bulging of the tympanic membrane, or
otorrhoea
decreased mobility on pneumatic otoscopy
inflammation of the tympanic membrane
i.e. erythema

Management

Acute otitis media is generally a self-limiting condition that does not require an antibiotic prescription. There are however some exceptions listed below. Analgesia should be given to relieve otalgia. Parents should be advised to seek medical help if the symptoms worsen or do not improve after 3 days.

Antibiotics should be prescribed immediately if:
Symptoms lasting more than 4 days or not improving
Systemically unwell but not requiring admission
Immunocompromise or high risk of complications secondary to significant heart, lung, kidney, liver, or neuromuscular disease
Younger than 2 years with bilateral otitis media
Otitis media with perforation and/or discharge in the canal

If an antibiotic is given, a 5-7 day course of amoxicillin is first-line. In patients with penicillin allergy, erythromycin or clarithromycin should be given.

Sequelae and complications

Common sequelae include:
perforation of the tympanic membrane → otorrhoea
unresolved with acute otitis media with perforation may develop into chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)
CSOM is defined as perforation of the tympanic membrane with otorrhoea for > 6 weeks
hearing loss
labyrinthitis

Complications:
mastoiditis
meningitis
brain abscess
facial nerve paralysis
