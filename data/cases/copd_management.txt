COPD: stable management 
NICE updated its guidelines on the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2018.

General management
>smoking cessation advice: including offering nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline or bupropion
annual influenza vaccination
one-off pneumococcal vaccination
pulmonary rehabilitation to all people who view themselves as functionally disabled by COPD (usually Medical Research Council [MRC] grade 3 and above)

Bronchodilator therapy
a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) or short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is first-line treatment
for patients who remain breathless or have exacerbations despite using short-acting bronchodilators the next step is determined by whether the patient has 'asthmatic features/features suggesting steroid responsiveness'

There are a number of criteria NICE suggest to determine whether a patient has asthmatic/steroid responsive features:
any previous, secure diagnosis of asthma or of atopy
a higher blood eosinophil count - note that NICE recommend a full blood count for all patients as part of the work-up
substantial variation in FEV1 over time (at least 400 ml)
substantial diurnal variation in peak expiratory flow (at least 20%)

Interestingly NICE do not recommend formal reversibility testing as one of the criteria. In the guidelines they state that 'routine spirometric reversibility testing is not necessary as part of the diagnostic process or to plan initial therapy with bronchodilators or corticosteroids. It may be unhelpful or misleading...'. They then go on to discuss why they have reached this conclusion. Please see the guidelines for more details.

No asthmatic features/features suggesting steroid responsiveness
add a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) + long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)
if already taking a SAMA, discontinue and switch to a SABA

Asthmatic features/features suggesting steroid responsiveness
LABA + inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
if patients remain breathless or have exacerbations offer triple therapy i.e. LAMA + LABA + ICS
if already taking a SAMA, discontinue and switch to a SABA
NICE recommend the use of combined inhalers where possible




Oral theophylline
NICE only recommends theophylline after trials of short and long-acting bronchodilators or to people who cannot used inhaled therapy
the dose should be reduced if macrolide or fluoroquinolone antibiotics are co-prescribed

Oral prophylactic antibiotic therapy
azithromycin prophylaxis is recommended in select patients
patients should not smoke, have optimised standard treatments and continue to have exacerbations
other prerequisites include a CT thorax (to exclude bronchiectasis) and sputum culture (to exclude atypical infections and tuberculosis)
LFTs and an ECG to exclude QT prolongation should also be done as azithromycin can prolong the QT interval

Standby medication: NICE recommend offering a short course of oral corticosteroids and oral antibiotics to keep at home if: NICE
have had an exacerbation within the last year
understand how to take the medication, and are aware of associated risks and benefits
know to when to seek help and when to ask for replacements once medication has been used

Mucolytics
should be 'considered' in patients with a chronic productive cough and continued if symptoms improve

Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors NICE
oral PDE-4 inhibitors such as roflumilast reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations in patients with severe COPD and a history of frequent COPD exacerbations
NICE recommend if:
the disease is severe, defined as a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after a bronchodilator of less than 50% of predicted normal, and
the person has had 2 or more exacerbations in the previous 12 months despite triple inhaled therapy with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, a long-acting beta-2 agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid

Cor pulmonale
features include peripheral oedema, raised jugular venous pressure, systolic parasternal heave, loud P2
use a loop diuretic for oedema, consider long-term oxygen therapy
ACE-inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and alpha blockers are not recommended by NICE

Factors which may improve survival in patients with stable COPD
smoking cessation - the single most important intervention in patients who are still smoking
long term oxygen therapy in patients who fit criteria
lung volume reduction surgery in selected patients
