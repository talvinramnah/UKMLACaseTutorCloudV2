Pneumothorax: management 
The British Thoracic Society (BTS) published updated guidelines for the management of spontaneous pneumothorax in 2023.

The updated guidelines put less emphasis on the size of the pneumothorax and more emphasis on whether the patient is symptomatic and the presence of high-risk characteristics.

Decision algorithm

The first step is assessing whether the patient is symptomatic
the BTS define minimal symptoms as 'no significant pain or breathlessness and no physiological compromise'
no or minimal symptoms → conservative care, regardless of pneumothorax size
symptomatic → assess for high-risk characteristics

If a pneumothorax is symptomatic, the next step is assessment for high-risk characteristics
high-risk characteristics are defined as follows:
haemodynamic compromise (suggesting a tension pneumothorax)
significant hypoxia
bilateral pneumothorax
underlying lung disease
≥ 50 years of age with significant smoking history
haemothorax
if no high-risk characteristics are present, and it is safe to intervene, then there is a choice of intervention:
conservative care
ambulatory device
needle aspiration
if high-risk characteristics are present, and it is safe to intervene → chest drain

How is safety or intervention determined?
before a needle aspiration/chest drain insertion, the safety of intervention should be assessed
this depends on the clinical context, but is usually:
2cm laterally or apically on chest x-ray, or
any size on CT scan which can be safely accessed with radiological support




Management options

Conservative care
patients with a primary spontaneous pneumothorax that is managed conservatively should be reviewed every 2-4 days as an outpatient
patients with a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax that is managed conservatively should be monitored as an inpatient
if stable, follow-up in the outpatients department in 2-4 weeks

Ambulatory care
an example of an ambulatory device is the Rocketµ Pleural Vent„
it includes an 8FG catheter mounted on an 18G needle and a pigtail catheter to minimize the risk of occlusion
ambulatory devices typically have a one-way valve and vent to prevent air and fluid return to the pleural space while allowing for controlled escape of air and drainage of fluid
many devices also have an indication diaphragm that signals when the catheter tip enters the pleural space and continues to fluctuate with respiration, aiding in the assessment of pneumothorax resolution



Needle aspiration
a chest drain should be inserted if needle aspiration of a pneumothorax is unsuccessful
if resolved, discharge and follow-up in the outpatients department in 2-4 weeks

Chest drain insertion
daily review as an inpatient
remove drain when resolved
discharge and follow-up in the outpatients department in 2-4 weeks

Persistentent / recurrent pneumothorax

If a patient has a persistent air leak or insufficient lung reexpansion despite chest drain insertion, or the patient has recurrent pneumothoraces, then video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) should be considered to allow for mechanical/chemical pleurodesis +/- bullectomy.

Discharge advice

Smoking
patients should be advised to avoid smoking to reduce the risk of further episodes - the lifetime risk of developing a pneumothorax in healthy smoking men is around 10% compared with around 0.1% in non-smoking men

Fitness to fly
absolute contraindication, the CAA suggest patients may travel 2 weeks after successful drainage if there is no residual air. The British Thoracic Society used to recommend not travelling by air for a period of 6 weeks but this has now been changed to 1 week post check x-ray

Scuba diving
the BTS guidelines state: 'Diving should be permanently avoided unless the patient has undergone bilateral surgical pleurectomy and has normal lung function and chest CT scan postoperatively.'
