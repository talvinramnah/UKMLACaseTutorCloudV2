Acute asthma: management 
The British Thoracic Society (BTS) classify patients with acute asthma into moderate, severe or life-threatening categories.

Moderate	Severe	Life-threatening
PEFR 50-75% best or predicted
Speech normal
RR < 25 / min
Pulse < 110 bpm	PEFR 33 - 50% best or predicted
Can't complete sentences
RR > 25/min
Pulse > 110 bpm	PEFR < 33% best or predicted
Oxygen sats < 92%
'Normal' pC02 (4.6-6.0 kPa)
Silent chest, cyanosis or feeble respiratory effort
Bradycardia, dysrhythmia or hypotension
Exhaustion, confusion or coma

Note that a patient having any one of the life-threatening features should be treated as having a life-threatening attack.

A fourth category, 'Near-fatal asthma', is also recognised characterised by a raised pC02 and/or requiring mechanical ventilation with raised inflation pressures.

Further assessment
the BTS guidelines recommend arterial blood gases for patients with oxygen sats < 92%
a chest x-ray is not routinely recommended, unless:
life-threatening asthma
suspected pneumothorax
failure to respond to treatment

Management
admission
all patients with life-threatening should be admitted in hospital
patients with features of severe acute asthma should also be admitted if they fail to respond to initial treatment.
other admission criteria include a previous near-fatal asthma attack, pregnancy, an attack occurring despite already using oral corticosteroid and presentation at night
oxygen
if patients are hypoxaemic, it is important to start them on supplemental oxygen therapy
if patients are acutely unwell they should be started on 15L of supplemental via a non-rebreathe mask, which can then be titrated down to a flow rate where they are able to maintain a SpO‚‚ 94-98%.
bronchodilation with short-acting beta‚‚-agonists (SABA)
high-dose inhaled SABA e.g. salbutamol, terbutaline
in patients without features of life-threatening or near-fatal asthma, this can be given by a standard pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) or by an oxygen-driven nebulizer
in patients with features of a life-threatening exacerbation of asthma, nebulised SABA is recommended
corticosteroid
all patients should be given 40-50mg of prednisolone orally (PO) daily, which should be continued for at least five days or until the patient recovers from the attack
during this time, patients should continue their normal medication routine including inhaled corticosteroids.
ipratropium bromide: in patients with severe or life-threatening asthma, or in patients who have not responded to beta‚‚-agonist and corticosteroid treatment, nebulised ipratropium bromide, a short-acting muscarinic antagonist
IV magnesium sulphate
the BTS notes that the evidence base is mixed for this treatment that is now commonly given for severe/life-threatening asthma
IV aminophylline may be considered following consultation with senior medical staff
patients who fail to respond require senior critical care support and should be treated in an appropriate ITU/HDU setting. Treatment options include:
intubation and ventilation
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)

Criteria for discharge
been stable on their discharge medication (i.e. no nebulisers or oxygen) for 12-24 hours
inhaler technique checked and recorded
PEF >75% of best or predicted
