Vestibular neuronitis 
Vestibular neuronitis is a cause of vertigo that often develops following a viral infection.

Features
recurrent vertigo attacks lasting hours or days
nausea and vomiting may be present
horizontal nystagmus is usually present
no hearing loss or tinnitus

Differential diagnosis
viral labyrinthitis
posterior circulation stroke: the HiNTs exam can be used to distinguish vestibular neuronitis from posterior circulation stroke

Management
buccal or intramuscular prochlorperazine is often used to provide rapid relief for severe cases
a short oral course of prochlorperazine, or an antihistamine (cinnarizine, cyclizine, or promethazine) may be used to alleviate less severe cases
vestibular rehabilitation exercises are the preferred treatment for patients who experience chronic symptoms
