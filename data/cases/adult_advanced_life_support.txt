Adult Advanced Life Support - Adult advanced life support The following is based on the 2021 Resus Council guidelines. Please see the link for more details, below is only a very brief summary of key points. It should be remembered that the algorithm divides patients into those with: 'shockable' rhythms: ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pulseless VT) 'non-shockable' rhythms: asystole/pulseless-electrical activity (asystole/PEA) Major points include: chest compressions the ratio of chest compressions to ventilation is 30:2 chest compressions are now continued while a defibrillator is charged defibrillation a single shock for VF/pulseless VT followed by 2 minutes of CPR if the cardiac arrested is witnessed in a monitored patient (e.g. in a coronary care unit) then the 2015 guidelines recommend 'up to three quick successive (stacked) shocks', rather than 1 shock followed by CPR drug delivery IV access should be attempted and is first-line if IV access cannot be achieved then drugs should be given via the intraosseous route (IO) delivery of drugs via a tracheal tube is no longer recommended adrenaline adrenaline 1 mg as soon as possible for non-shockable rhythms during a VF/VT cardiac arrest, adrenaline 1 mg is given once chest compressions have restarted after the third shock repeat adrenaline 1mg every 3-5 minutes whilst ALS continues amiodarone amiodarone 300 mg should be given to patients who are in VF/pulseless VT after 3 shocks have been administered. a further dose of amiodarone 150 mg should be given to patients who are in VF/pulseless VT after 5 shocks have been administered lidocaine used as an alternative if amiodarone is not available or a local decision has been made to use lidocaine instead thrombolytic drugs should be considered if a pulmonary embolus is suspected if given, CPR should be continued for an extended period of 60-90 minutes Other points atropine is no longer recommended for routine use in asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA) following successful resuscitation oxygen should be titrated to achieve saturations of 94-98%. This is to address the potential harm caused by hyperoxaemia Reversible causes of cardiac arrest: The 'Hs' The 'Ts' Hypoxia Hypovolaemia Hyperkalaemia, hypokalaemia, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, acidaemia and other metabolic disorders Hypothermia Thrombosis (coronary or pulmonary) Tension pneumothorax Tamponade - cardiac Toxins
